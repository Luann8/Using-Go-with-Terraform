# Using Go with Terraform

## Introduction

Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and manage your infrastructure using a simple declarative language. Go is a popular programming language known for its efficiency and performance. Using Go with Terraform enables extending Terraform's functionalities by writing custom code to automate specific tasks.

## Why Use Go with Terraform?

1. **Flexibility**: Go is a powerful and versatile language that provides flexibility to implement complex logics.

2. **Performance**: Code written in Go tends to have superior performance, which can be beneficial for compute-intensive operations.

3. **Ecosystem**: The Go ecosystem is rich in libraries and tools that can be leveraged to extend Terraform.

## How to Use Go with Terraform

There are several ways to use Go with Terraform:

### 1. **Local Provisioners**

Local provisioners allow you to execute scripts or local commands in your environment during the Terraform lifecycle. This enables integrating custom Go code into your Terraform workflows.

Example:

```hcl
resource "null_resource" "run_go_code" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "go run main.go ${var.input}"
  }

  triggers = {
    input = "input_value"
  }
}

```
### 2. Custom Plugins
You can create custom plugins in Go to extend Terraform's functionalities. Custom plugins allow adding new providers, resources, and features to Terraform.

### 3. Go Resources in Terraform
You can use Go resources directly in your Terraform configurations. This is useful for creating custom resources that are not available natively in Terraform.

### 4. Go Modules
You can create custom Go modules to encapsulate specific and reusable functionalities. Go modules can be integrated into your Terraform configurations to simplify infrastructure management.
